                <p>
                    My name is Drake Allen Matfield. I am very ambitious and want to do great things.
                    A few of them being, I want to start a non-profit organization, own my own business
                    And it’s been my life dream to create a video game. Currently, I am a self taught
                    programmer; and I wish to one day to enter into the industry officially. I have
                    a few project ideas that I have began; but they have yet to catch any momentum.</p>

                <h2>
                    Where I'm From
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I’m born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. Despite what many other citizens might
                    say I love my City and can’t imagine living anywhere else.
                </p>

            <!-- section (More about me) -->
            <section>
                <h2>
                    More About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I have a certain degree of awareness of my own emotions; thus I tend
                    to notice when I’m feeling a particular way and take my feelings into account when
                    making decisions. I tend to think in both abstract ways—in terms of metaphors—and
                    logically. Therefore, in my work and free time, I enjoy activities that get my “creative
                    juices” flowing, but are also able to keep my mind on the primary objective of the
                    task at hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My tendency to be both open-minded, yet realistic is generally quite advantageous.
                    For instance, when there are no clear rules about how to approach a particular problem,
                    my openness makes it easy for me to identify new ways to solve problems that might
                    not be very obvious to people that are not as open as I am. However, because I’m
                    also realistic-minded, I’m able to follow-rules quite easily. This combination makes
                    it easy for me to excel in your work because I’m able to “think outside the box”
                    while still being able to keep my eyes on “the big picture.” I’m someone who is
                    moderate in openness, I have an appreciation for art and nature, but is also down
                    to earth and realistic. I’m fond of music and art. But I also enjoy and appreciate
                    things that have a clear point and some sort of practical utility.
