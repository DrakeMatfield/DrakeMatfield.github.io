                        This is my portfolio for my web class. In it is my class projects and a few of my
                        own personal workings. Feel free to explore them. Each selection contains a small
                        description about the project; and a link to the project.

                        As a part of the course the projects we do as part of the course should be link
                        to Gib hub. As such I did add some of my personal projects to git hub to full fill
                        the course requirements. However some of my person projects doesn’t seem valid for
                        the platform. and therefore will not include a link to git hub; but to it’s relative
                        content.

In this assignment, I build a FizzBuzz app from scratch.
</p>
                            <span class="read-more-target">
                                <p>
<ul>
In the original game of Fizz Buzz, you count from 1 to a given number (let's say 100). For each number if it's not divisible by 3 or 5, you simply say the number. If it's divisible by 3, instead of the number you say "fizz". If it's divisible by 5, you say "buzz". And finally if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "fizz buzz".
</br>
</br>
So, counting from 1 to 15, you'd say: "1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizz buzz".

This is admittedly not a very useful program, but as it turns out it's a great small project to do, for two reasons. First, it brings together all of the programming fundamentals we've learned so far. To complete this project, you'll need to use loops, conditionals and the modulo operator (and that's about all the help you'll get from us about implementing the JavaScript). Second, and as a consequence of the first point, FizzBuzz is a popular problem that interviewees will be asked to solve in technical interviews. If your goal is to become a professional developer, you definitely should know how to code up FizzBuzz. According to some commentators, the ability to code up FizzBuzz falls flat amongst the top half percent of programmers who actually know how to program! The requirements for this app are as follows:

<li>DO NOT spend any time designing this app or making it look pretty. We don't want you to consider UX at all here, since the point is to build up your programming fundamentals.</li>
<li>At a minimum, you'll need an HTML file and a JavaScript file. The HTML file should link to your application JavaScript file. The program should append each number (or its "fizz"/"buzz"/"fizzbuzz" substitution) to the body element of the DOM (On the page) or simple console program will work.</li>
<li>The program should print out each number (not 'one' for 1, but 1 for 1), from 1 to 100, replacing numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with "fizz buzz", those divisible by 3 with "fizz", and those divisible by 5 with "buzz".</li>
</ul>

                                    The Love Chronicles of Drake and Eumeaka are writings consisting of collections

                                    - Which he believe might be Eumeaka! While during this he find himself in the mist
                                    of a conspiracy that threatens his life.

                                I decided to use Anura as my debut character; since she had the most potential and
                                is easily tied into the Love Chronicles.

                                    Because I was in desperate need for some quick cash, I ponder a quick scheme of
                                    making some money fast. I had my story; but it is far from finish; and I didn't
                                    want to rush it either. If and when the Love Chronicles of Drake and Eumeaka made
                                    its debut I want things to be perfect.

                                    Unfortunately, developing Anura as the first Publication and lead into the Love
                                    Chronicles of Drake and Eumeaka isn't going to be an easy task. Anura is going to
                                    take at least 2 months; but more realistically 3 months before being ready to sell.

                                    Initially, Project X card began as a gimmick that started in a Facebook group I
                                    was associated with. Many members of the group would make alter graphical image
                                    of famous Trading card games cards as part of an ongoing joke.

                                    But I wish Project X card to be more than just software. I wish it to also be a
                                    community development project; thus the name project is left into its published
                                    name.
